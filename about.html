      <h1>We are JAQRUIZ</h1>
      <p>
        The world gives and we keep on taking, with all its consequences.
        Australia is burning, the North Pole is evaporating, The Netherlands is
        drowning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Constantly, we are discussing the next generation that should solve this
        problem, but why wouldnâ€™t we consider ourselves the next generation? How
        do you provide change as an individual? It is difficult and you might
        feel helpless. We felt the same, but now we wave those powerless
        feelings goodbye.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are JAQRUIZ and we fight back. For years on end, we have been
        consuming at the expense of innocent and vulnerable animals. Now, we
        will fight alongside them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will hold ourselves to a new standard. A standard in which the planet
        does not bear the cost of people and profits, but the latter will
        contribute to the former: fashion, goal and means in one. Clothing that
        helps the conservation of our earth and facilitates you walking around
        dressed drip. Of every item of clothing that you buy, 10% of the revenue
        will support the conservation and protection of wildlife.
